# NORAD manuscript

## MYCN knock-down and overlapping gene signature with NORAD knock-down
RNA-sequencing results was downloaded from ArrayExpress accession [E-GEOD-84389](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-GEOD-84389/) and  differential expression results was obtained from the excel sheet "TEAD4-MYCN KD DGE signature" within [Table S7 RNA-seq derived signatures and pathway analysis from shTEAD4, shMYCN ans shWWTR1](http://cancerdiscovery.aacrjournals.org/highwire/filestream/43006/field_highwire_adjunct_files/6/169577_3_supp_4574645_p49g2y.xlsx) from the article [Cross-Cohort Analysis Identifies a TEAD4â€“MYCN Positive Feedback Loop as the Core Regulatory Element of High-Risk Neuroblastoma](http://cancerdiscovery.aacrjournals.org/content/8/5/582)
[NORAD.knockdown.CPM.BE2.txt](https://github.com/utnesp/NORAD/blob/master/NORAD.knockdown.CPM.BE2.txt). Differential expression between NORAD and MYCN was compared based on the normalized data from MYCN knock-down and [NORAD knock-down](https://github.com/utnesp/NORAD/blob/master/NORAD.knockdown.CPM.BE2.txt) in the neuroblastoma cell line SK-N-BE(2)c. The overlapping gene signature was found based on the script [MYCN.NORAD.knockdown.BE2.R](https://github.com/utnesp/NORAD/blob/master/MYCN.NORAD.knockdown.BE2.R).
